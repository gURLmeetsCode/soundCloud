# Project Title

Build a small application using the SoundCloud public API. The goal of your application is to provide an interesting way to explore tracks via SoundCloudâ€™s Search API. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Running the tests

Utilized Mocha and Chai for unit testing. Test markups can be found in test.js.

### Summary of Tests

The purpose of the tests is to check for any loop holes within the code. I want to ensure the code runs seamslessly for a great user experience.
