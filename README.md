# SoundCloud API - Ads Engineering Internship

Build a small application using the SoundCloud public API. The goal of your application is to provide an interesting way to explore tracks via SoundCloudâ€™s Search API.

## Getting Started

This project is in a Zip file. To install a Zip file please refer to the following:

 .ZIP files must be unzipped before they can be used. To unzip a .ZIP file, you need an unzipping program. Most unzipping programs can unzip files and immediately run a setup program that may be inside the .ZIP file. See your unzipping program's documentation for how to do this.


## Running the tests

Utilized Mocha and Chai for unit testing. Test markups can be found in test.js.

### Summary of Tests

The purpose of the tests is to check for any loop holes within the code. I want to ensure the code runs seamlessly for a great user experience.

Issues with unit test: unable to complete testing for API call. Expected response was 200 but recieved 401. Also unable to run test for script functions -- needed better undertstanding for testing scripts.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - The web framework used
